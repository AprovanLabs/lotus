# Unstyled Components

## Background

There are a million component libraries that provided you styled, ready-to-use components: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (oldest and most famous), [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/components) (originally by Google), or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) (by Alibaba). These are great for quick prototypes or projects that don't need a lot of customization. However, they can be difficult to customize and can be difficult to integrate into existing projects.

Introducing 'unstyled components'. These libraries provide robust components (much like the original HTML ones such as `a`, `div`, `button`, ...) but don't include any styling. This allows for full customization without having to build things from scratch.

## Shadcn

[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is a library of unstyled components that include examples. This is a great way to quickly include a new component into a product and then restyle it to fit the use-case, later. It uses Tailwind for the styling.
