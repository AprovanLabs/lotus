## Keeping Track of Hours

Use a time tracking tool to keep track of your hours. [Clockify](https://clockify.me/lp/timesheet-app?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=US:PER_nSignals:SignUp_wnPurchase_tROAS:G&utm_agid=&utm_term=&device=c&gad=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoI3B8buK_wIVvgOzAB2HPwv1EAAYASAAEgLY3fD_BwE) is a free time tracking tool that is easy to use. A stopwatch works as well.

Each week, before Monday morning, send a report of your hours. This report should include the hours you worked on each day (rounded to the nearest 5 minutes), a brief description of the task, and the total hours for the week.
